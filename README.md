# Login-System
This login system consists of three HTML pages and two servlets:

HTML Pages

homepage.html – Displays two options: Login and Registration.

login.html – Allows users to enter their username and password.

registration.html – Allows new users to enter their details for account creation.

Servlets

LoginServlet – Handles login requests.

It checks whether the provided credentials exist in the database.

If the credentials are valid, it displays "Welcome +<User-Name>".

If the credentials are invalid, it shows "User Name is Invalid".

RegistrationServlet – Handles registration requests by storing the user’s information in the database.

A diagram illustrates the complete flow of the system.
